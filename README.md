# JS Slide in-on Scroll

---

## The "JavaScript JS Slide-in-on-Scroll" project is part of Wes Bos's "JavaScript30" challenge series. In this particular project, participants learn how to create animations that slide elements into view as the user scrolls down a webpage.

The project consists of a series of coding challenges that gradually introduce concepts related to creating and animating elements in JavaScript. Participants will learn how to use the Intersection Observer API to detect when an element enters and exits the viewport, and how to use CSS transitions and animations to create smooth sliding animations.

Throughout the project, participants will work with various CSS properties and selectors, including transform, translateX, and translateY, as well as JavaScript methods such as getBoundingClientRect() and Array.from(). They will also learn how to manipulate the DOM to add and remove classes and styles dynamically.

By the end of the "JavaScript JS-slide-in-on-scroll" project, participants will have a solid understanding of how to create animations that slide elements into view as the user scrolls down a webpage, and will be able to apply this knowledge to their own JavaScript projects. They will also have gained experience working with the Intersection Observer API and manipulating the DOM in JavaScript.
