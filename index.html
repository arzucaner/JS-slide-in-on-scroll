    <p>I had decided to leave my comfort zone while embarking on a long journey in foggy weather. If your work has nothing else to add to you and your dreams are different, the universe may be giving you a message…</p>
    <p>The first question everyone is wondering: Am I ready to step out of my comfort zone?
    As someone who has been in corporate business life for years, I had a breaking point. While I was driving my vehicle in that foggy weather, I asked myself that wonderful question.</p>
    <p>Am I where want to be? Unfortunately, I was not. I was just where others wanted me to be. Life was too short and I had the courage and dreams to start all over again.</p>
    <p>I think that people who have achieved success are people who have stepped out of their comfort zone and can keep up with constant change. I left the status I had achieved by working for many years. Far from my comfort zone, I opened wings towards new beginnings. By putting courage, determination and all the good feelings in my suitcase.</p>

    <p>The second question everyone is wondering: Was it the right decision?</p>

    <p> Definitely, Yes. I built a new life that is all mine…</p>
